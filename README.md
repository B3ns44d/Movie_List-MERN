# INTRO TO THIS PROJECT

This porject is platform built with _ReactJS_ and _BLACKAPI_ (if you don't what is this BLACKAPI I recommend you to check the [BLACKAPI GitHub repo](https://github.com/B3ns44d/BlackAPI))  so this website includes a list of all the movies and series that I have watched, and I also provided a time tracker for each movie and series and the total time **I wasted watching these movies** ... 
*This was a simple introduction to this project*

## TOOLS I USEED FOR THIS PROJECT 

 - **First let's start with the API** that a build using **NODEJS** and **MONGODB** and **EXPRESSJS**  and **AUTH0** so Let's talk about the role of this API in this project, simply this API provides us with
   all the information that we use on the site such as the name, movies,
   pictures....., everything is stored in the database that is MONGODB
   and manged by **EXPRESS** and **NODE**
   
 - **Now The ReactJS part**  for this project  I use ReactJS, Material UI, and a few other things to develop the frontend of this website.

## WHY I MADE THIS WEBSITE FOR 

There are many reasons that prompted the development of this site, but there are the main reasons that come...

 - **Train my skills in MERN STACK**
 - To stop people from asking about the movies that I watched
 - And to share my reviews of the movies and series I have watched with people

## FEATURES COMING üëæ

I am working on developing this site more and more in the future, and these are the features that I am working on currently

 - The area for people to discuss their opinions about a particular movie or series.
 - An area for people to share the movies and series they watched and evaluated.
 - An area for music that I love and listen to every day while I coding. **(in process)**
 -  more stuff....

## DEMO
**You can visit the demo version of this project using this [link](https://b3ns44d-list.herokuapp.com/)**

**NOTE:** This is only the beta version of the website, it is not the final product and I have some things to add and I have not finished pushing/listing all my movies and series to the API ...
